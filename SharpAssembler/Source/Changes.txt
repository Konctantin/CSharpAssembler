* ObjectFile.AddNewSection() is moved to SectionCollection.AddNew()
+ IObjectFileVisitor interface has a lot of new methods
Changes:
+ CustomConstructable object

SharpAssembler 0.7.1
--------------------
Breaking changes:
* Constructable.Construct signature
  It now returns a IList<IEmittable> instead of an IEmittable.
  This allows for more complex instructions returning more than one IEmittable.
- Constructable.Parent property
  To allow Constructables to be used in places other than just Sections.
* Symbol..ctor(IAssociatable, SymbolType, string) signature
  The name is now the last parameter to the constructor.
Changes:
+ Group class
  Can group multiple constructables together.
+ ConstructableList class
  Ordered list for Constructable objects.
+ Reference..ctor(IAssociatable) constructor
* Symbols are no longer required to have an identifier.
  Obviously, symbols without an identifier cannot be looked up by identifier in the SymbolTable, and object file
  writers may restrict symbols that have no identifier.
