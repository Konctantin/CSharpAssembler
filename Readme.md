Installation instructions
=========================
Extract the ZIP archive somewhere, and reference the DLL files from your project. You'll need to reference at least the `Core` library (`SharpAssembler Core.dll`), and add anything you may want to use. The following add-on libraries are included:
* x86-64 architecture (in `SharpAssembler x86-64.dll`)
* BIN file format (in `SharpAssembler Bin File Format.dll`)

The libraries have Code Contracts applied to them. You are not required to support them, and it will still work. However, if you want to support them, you can get the Code Contracts Development Tools from the [Microsoft DevLabs website](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/dd491992).

Support
=======
You can get support at the [SharpAssembler website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sharpassembler/). For anything from bugs, feature requests, suggestions, documentation errors, inconsistencies and things that are not clear you may create a new ticker or start a new forum discussion topic.
